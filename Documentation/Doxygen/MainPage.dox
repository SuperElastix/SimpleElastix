\section intro Introduction
Image registration is the process of transforming images into a common coordinate system so corresponding pixels represent homologous biological points. SimpleElastix is an extension of SimpleITK that offers a user-friendly API to the popular image registration algorithms of the elastix C++ library. This makes state-of-the-art medical image registration really easy to do in languages like Python, Java, C# and R. This package provides

- elastix and transformix bindings for C++, Python, Java, R, Ruby, Octave, Lua, Tcl and C# (see elastix manual for a list of supported registration algorithms).
- Pre-configured registration methods that work well in many cases and serve as starting points for tuning elastix to domain-specific applications.
- Installation guides, examples, and introductory material at simpleelastix.readthedocs.org.
- A user-friendly API that aligns with the design philosophy of SimpleITK developed specifically for rapid prototyping. If you are interested, The Design of SimpleITK is a great read.
- The complete set of SimpleITK image processing algorithms.

This documentation describes the C++ API of the SimpleITK interface
to the Insight Toolkit. The wrapped languages have a very similar
interface, that should only be trivially different.  The
Related Pages link presents interface conventions, user and
developer information. Additionally the Example tab provides a
variety of example of SimpleITK with different language bindings.
