\section intro Introduction
Image registration is the process of transforming images into a common coordinate system so corresponding pixels represent homologous biological points. SimpleElastix is an extension of SimpleITK that offers a user-friendly API to the popular image registration algorithms of the elastix C++ library. This makes state-of-the-art medical image registration really easy to do in languages like Python, Java, C# and R. This package provides

\section intro Introduction

SimpleITK is a simplified programming interface to the algorithms and data structures of the Insight Toolkit (ITK) for image analysis.
It supports interfaces for multiple programming languages including C++, Python, R, Java, C#, Lua, Ruby and TCL. These language
bindings facilitate research, rapid software prototyping and education.

The main characteristics of SimpleITK include:
- C++ library
- Object-oriented
- Provides a simplified, easy-to-use, procedural interface
- Is distributed under an open source Apache 2.0 License
- Binary distributions for Python, C# and Java

Toolkit development is overseen by the Insight Software Consortium,
a non-profit, educational consortium dedicated to promoting and
maintaining open-source, freely available software for medical image analysis.

- elastix and transformix bindings for C++, Python, Java, R, Ruby, Octave, Lua, Tcl and C# (see elastix manual for a list of supported registration algorithms).
- Pre-configured registration methods that work well in many cases and serve as starting points for tuning elastix to domain-specific applications.
- Installation guides, examples, and introductory material at simpleelastix.readthedocs.org.
- A user-friendly API that aligns with the design philosophy of SimpleITK developed specifically for rapid prototyping. If you are interested, The Design of SimpleITK is a great read.
- The complete set of SimpleITK image processing algorithms.

This documentation describes the SimpleITK C++ API.
The wrapped languages have a very similar
interface, that should only be trivially different.
