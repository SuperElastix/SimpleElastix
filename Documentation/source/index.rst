SimpleElastix
=============

SimpleElastix makes state-of-the-art medical image registration really easy to do in Python, Java, R, Ruby, Octave, Lua, Tcl and C# by exposing a native interface to the robust C++ algorithms of the elastix registration library in theses languages. If you know the basic syntax in any of these languages e.g. write a for loop, you can perform state-of-the-art image registration with SimpleElastix. Applying the right algorithm to the right problem is the real challenge 


Image registration is the process of transforming images into a common coordinate system so corresponding pixels represent homologous biological points. This is a prerequisite for a wide range of medical image analysis tasks and a key algorithmic component for statistical analysis and machine learning in medical image processing. 


.. note:: 
    SimpleElastix documentation is currently under development. We aim to port `all ITK registration examples <http://itk.org/Wiki/ITK/Examples/Included/Registration>`_ to SimpleElastix. *You* can contribute with pull requests on Github.
