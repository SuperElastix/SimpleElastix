SimpleElastix
=============

SimpleElastix is a medical image processing package that makes state-of-the-art medical image registration really easy to do. This is accomplished by exposing native interfaces to the robust C++ algorithms of the elastix registration library in Python, Java, R, Ruby, Octave, Lua, Tcl and C# so you can focus on applying the right algorithm to your dataset using your language of choice. If you know the basic syntax in any of these languages (like how to write a for loop), you are ready to perform state-of-the-art image registration. 


Image registration is the process of transforming images into a common coordinate system so corresponding pixels represent homologous biological points. This is a prerequisite for a wide range of medical image analysis tasks and a key algorithmic component for statistical analysis and machine learning in medical image processing. 


.. note:: 
    SimpleElastix documentation is currently under development. We aim to port `all ITK registration examples <http://itk.org/Wiki/ITK/Examples/Included/Registration>`_ to SimpleElastix. *You* can contribute with pull requests on Github.
